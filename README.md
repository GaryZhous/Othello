# Othello
It was initially an Othello game made based on minimax algorithm (but I hard-coded most of it) at depth up to 6. It includes some recursive call but it is mainly for the increment of depth.
This program once reached #6 on UofT APS105(Computer Fundamentals) lab8 reversi Leaderboard...

I used Qt with Qmake to embody my codes with a GUI which allows huamn-huamn and human-computer matches with ab-pruning and some run-time optimization. Now it's faster and more efficient!
```sh
git clone https://github.com/GaryZhous/Othello/tree/main/othello_qt <your project file>
