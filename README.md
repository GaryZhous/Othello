I used Qt with Qmake to embody my codes with a GUI which allows human-human and human-computer matches with ab-pruning and some run-time optimization. Now it's faster and more efficient!

If you are new to QT and you are a student, you can request QT's [educational license](https://www.qt.io/qt-educational-license) here!
```sh
git clone https://github.com/GaryZhous/Othello/tree/main/othello_qt <your project file>
```

or download the released source codes to deploy it on ur computer once you have Qt Designer installed!
