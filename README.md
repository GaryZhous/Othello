# Othello
It was initially an Othello game made based on minimax algorithm at depth up to 6. It includes some recursive call but it is mainly for the increment of depth.
This program once reached #6 on UofT APS105(Computer Fundamentals) lab8 reversi Leaderboard...

I used Qt with Qmake to embody my codes with a GUI which allows human-human and human-computer matches with ab-pruning and some run-time optimization. Now it's faster and more efficient!

If you are new to QT and you are a student, you can request QT's [educational license](https://www.qt.io/qt-educational-license) here!
```sh
git clone https://github.com/GaryZhous/Othello <your project file>
```

or download the released source codes to deploy this project on ur computer once you have Qt Designer installed!
### main.cpp

### othello_qt
